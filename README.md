Public repo for gdbinit

x86/x86_64 and ARM are supported simultaneously since version 8.0.

To make ARM the default CPU set the $ARM var to 1 or use the "arm" command to switch.

If you are a LLDB user this has been replaced with [lldbinit](https://github.com/gdbinit/lldbinit). Same look, more features!

You should read the header of the script for important information regarding some Mac OS X/iOS gdb bugs.

Have fun,
